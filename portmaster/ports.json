You can compare it to Portal, where you have to find clever uses of the mechanics and physics to \"solve\" each location by reaching the desired location. You have limited resources to make each jump, comparable to Celeste. But instead of focusing on precision-platforming, the game focuses on the puzzle aspect. Unlike Celeste, the hard part is figuring out how to use your resources to make each jump instead of the execution. But don't get fooled; the execution is also hard, which means finding each solution is even harder!",

For fans that come from the animation, the game is not a 1 to 1 replica of the animated film. I am not trying to make this a hardcore Meatboy-type game, I want to introduce challenging moments but I will try to make the difficulty curve as smooth as possible.\n\nThe early game will be pretty chill, just imagine how the Mario games were designed, then newer harder mechanics get slowly introduced. Big inspirations again were Mario World and Super Mario Bros Wii and also a fan-game called Mario 63.",

Wait for it to finish.\n- Open Sunshine for the first time. It will open up a window in your default browser.\n- It may give a warning about your connection not being private. Click on advanced and continue to localhost.\n- Here you will set the username and password for Sunshine, set it to something simple and memorable. It will ask for it every time.\n- The page will reload and then you will log into Sunshine. \n- Now its time to open Moonlight on your handheld. \n- First head to the *\"Settings Menu\"* and set them how you would like. Preferably start off with a low bitrate and your devices native resolution and framerate. \n- Lets move to the *\"Connect Menu\"*. Here you will first set your host device IP-address. \n- You will be able to find this by going to your network settings, properties and under *\"IPv4 address\"*.\n- Now its time to pair. Head to the *\"Pin\"* section on your host PC. \n- Click *\"Pair\"* in the Moonlight port. This will now show a pin. Fill this pin into Sunshine. Also fill in the device name, this can be named after your device such a *\"RG35XX\"*. \n- After sending the signal on you host PC, you will receive a message *\"Succesfully paired\"* in the moonlight app on your handheld. \n- Head over to the *\"Reload Apps\"* function on your handheld. Click on it and you will see the currently configured apps from Sunshine. Every time you update the Apps in Sunshine, use this function.\n- Head to the *\"Play Menu\"* and select the app you want to stream, Steam for example. \n- The Moonlight app will close on your handheld and it will start streaming. Wait 5 seconds for the controls.\n- Have fun!\n\n## Recommendations: ##\n- Moonlight requires a very good internet connection to get a decent experience. There are many factors at play such a the detail of the game your running. Simpler 2d games are easier to stream and require less power to decode on your handheld. You will have to try and find a balance of bitrate and framerate for your setup. \n- Experiencing input and/or audio delay? Lower the bitrate, resolution, or framerate. Reconnecting may help random desyncing issues.\n- Moonlight will maintain aspect ratio of your host PC monitor. You can get a better picture by manually changing the resolution to your devices native resolution, such as 640x480. There are ways to automate this process, such as  [ResolutionAutomation](https://github.com/Nonary/ResolutionAutomation). Use these programs on your own risk.\n- Inputs may be reversed. Mouse mode does not work on Moonlight-Embedded. Both can be resolved by using SteamInput.\n- Its recommended to check your connection before streaming, use the pair function for this. Does it say *\"Already paired\"*, then youre good to go. It may also say something like *\"App already opened\"*, you need to use *\"Force Close\"* under the troubleshooting options in Sunshine.\n- Most important of all, dont expect an amazing experience going in. These handhelds are not ideal for Streaming, even though they may seem like it.\n",

But instead of crashing, he fell into a mysterious hole in the ground. He’ll have to fly through a lot of mines and tunnels and meet unexpected visitors. As the game progresses, the unsuccessful skydiver will have to use all his skill and reaction to survive. You will have very little time to assess the situation and make the right decisions, so be prepared to engage your entire concentration. Try to catch Zen (without burning your ass)!",

When he hasn’t returned six months later, Tilia decides it’s up to her to track down her dad and find out what went wrong.\n\nPlay as Tilia as she travels across an archipelago full of pirate forts, forgotten magic, abominable beasts, and a diverse cast of people trying to find their place in it all. As Tilia follows her dad’s trail, she becomes entrangled in the pirates’ plot to use an old magic to control the ocean. And maybe along the way, she’ll play in a tick-tack-toe championship, prevent an art heist, or impresonate a piano tuner. It’s a large world full of secrets, dangers, and quirky wierdos for you to explore.",
