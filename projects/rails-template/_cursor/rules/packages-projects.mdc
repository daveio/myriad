# Package Managers

## JavaScript/TypeScript
Use `bun` for package management. In `package.json` scripts, use `bun run` prefix.

## Python
Use `uv` for project initialization and management. Prefer manager-agnostic directives in package definitions; use `uv`-specific directives only when generic options aren't feasible.
