# Myriad Repository Guide for AI Assistants

This document provides guidance for AI assistants like Claude to effectively understand and work with the "myriad" repository. Use this as a reference when helping users with this codebase.

## Repository Overview

The "myriad" repository is a collection of miscellaneous utilities, scripts, and guides across various programming languages and technologies. It serves as a personal toolkit containing solutions to specific problems. The repository includes:

- Python utilities for handling image metadata and music organization
- Fish shell scripts for system administration and terminal utilities
- Network configuration guides and documentation

This repository follows a modular structure where each utility is self-contained within its directory, making it easier to understand and use independently.

## Repository Structure

### Images Directory (`/images`)

Contains image resources organized into subdirectories:

- **multipurpose**: Generic images that can be used across various projects and contexts.

   - Suggest validating input data before operations
   - For Fish scripts, propose echo statements to trace execution
   - For TypeScript tools, recommend using the `--dry-run` flag if available

## Example Responses

### Example 1: User asking about orphaned-xmp usage

```bash
To find orphaned XMP files in your photography directory, you can use the orphaned-xmp tool like this:

1. Navigate to your photos directory:
   cd ~/Photos

2. Run the tool in dry-run mode first to see what would be deleted:
   python /path/to/myriad/python/orphaned-xmp/orphaned_xmp/cli.py --dry-run

3. If the results look correct and you want to delete the orphaned files:
   python /path/to/myriad/python/orphaned-xmp/orphaned_xmp/cli.py --delete

The tool will:
- Find all XMP files in the directory
- Check if each XMP file has a corresponding media file
- Report (or delete) XMP files without matching media files

This helps clean up your photo library by removing metadata files for images you've deleted.
```

### Example 2: User asking about modifying sixkcd.fish

````fish
To modify the sixkcd.fish script to display comics at a different size, you'll want to edit the image processing part of the script.

Look for this line around line 162:

```fish
fetch_url $xkcd_imgurl | magick - -resize 250% - | $DISPLAY_IMAGE
````

Change the 250% value to adjust the size. For example, to make it smaller:

```fish
fetch_url $xkcd_imgurl | magick - -resize 150% - | $DISPLAY_IMAGE
```

Or to make it larger:

```fish
fetch_url $xkcd_imgurl | magick - -resize 350% - | $DISPLAY_IMAGE
```

This works because the script uses ImageMagick to resize the image before displaying it with either imgcat (for iTerm2) or img2sixel (for terminals with sixel support).

Remember to make the script executable after editing:
chmod +x sixkcd.fish

### Example 3: User asking about netflow setup
```

To set up the netflow monitoring system described in the guide, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have the prerequisites:

   - A server/VM running Docker and Docker Compose
   - A Mikrotik router running RouterOS 7
   - Basic networking knowledge

2. Create the docker-compose.yml file:

   - Copy the example from the netflow/README.md file
   - Save it to a directory on your server

3. Create the ntopng.conf file in the same directory with the configuration from the guide

4. Start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Configure your Mikrotik router:

   - Enable Traffic Flow (IP → Traffic Flow)
   - Add your Docker host as a target with port 2055 and version 9

6. Verify it's working:
   - Check container logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
   - Access ntopng web interface at <http://your-server-ip:3000>

The most common issues are:

- Firewall blocking UDP port 2055
- Incorrect IP address configuration
- Missing volumes for persistent data

Would you like me to help with any specific part of this setup?

### Example 4: User asking about the bump utility

```
To use the bump utility for updating dependencies across your repositories:

1. Basic usage:
   ```bash
   # Update all repositories
   bump
   
   # Update a specific repository
   bump your-repo-name
   ```

2. If you want to see what would be updated without making changes:
   ```bash
   bump --dry-run
   ```

3. To update all dependencies including major versions (which are skipped by default):
   ```bash
   bump --unsafe
   ```

4. To skip certain git operations:
   ```bash
   # Skip committing changes
   bump --no-commit
   
   # Skip pushing changes
   bump --no-push
   ```

The tool will:
- Find repositories to process
- Check for outdated dependencies
- Apply updates based on semantic versioning rules
- Update lockfiles
- Commit and push changes (unless disabled)

It supports JavaScript/TypeScript (package.json), Python (pyproject.toml), and Ruby (Gemfile, gemspec) projects.
```

## Final Notes

When working with this repository:

1. **Understand the scope**: Each utility solves a specific problem rather than being a general-purpose application.

2. **Consider the environment**: Many tools assume a macOS environment with specific terminal capabilities.

3. **Acknowledge tool maturity**: These are personal utilities that may not have extensive error handling or documentation.

4. **Respect coding style**: Follow the established patterns when suggesting modifications to maintain consistency.
