# Myriad Repository Guide for AI Assistants

This document provides guidance for AI assistants like Claude to effectively understand and work with the "myriad" repository. Use this as a reference when helping users with this codebase.

## Repository Overview

The "myriad" repository is a collection of miscellaneous utilities, scripts, and guides across various programming languages and technologies. It serves as a personal toolkit containing solutions to specific problems. The repository includes:

- Python utilities for handling image metadata and music organization
- Fish shell scripts for system administration and terminal utilities
- Network configuration guides and documentation

This repository follows a modular structure where each utility is self-contained within its directory, making it easier to understand and use independently.

## Repository Structure

### Python Directory (`/python`)

Contains Python utilities organized into separate projects:

- **orphaned-xmp**: A utility to find and manage orphaned XMP sidecar files (metadata files used in photography workflows). The tool identifies XMP files that no longer have corresponding media files and provides options to delete or report them.

- **xmp-mover**: A utility to find XMP files with companion files (same base name but different extensions) and move them to a designated directory. Useful for organizing photography assets.

- **musicbrainz-picard**: Utilities related to MusicBrainz Picard, a music tagger and organizer. Contains tools to enhance or extend Picard functionality.

### Shell Directory (`/shell`)

Contains Fish shell scripts for various system tasks:

- **asdf-latest.fish**: A utility for managing the asdf version manager, helping to keep language runtimes up to date.

- **mastodon-maintenance.fish**: Maintenance scripts for Mastodon instances, automating common administration tasks.

- **sixkcd.fish**: A script to display XKCD comics in terminal using sixel graphics. Works with iTerm2 or terminals that support sixel graphics.

### Mixed Directory (`/mixed`)

Contains guides and configurations involving multiple technologies:

- **netflow**: A comprehensive guide for setting up network flow monitoring using ntopng with netflow2ng in Docker and Mikrotik RouterOS 7. Includes Docker configuration, router setup, and troubleshooting information.

## Best Practices for Code Suggestions and Troubleshooting

1. **Code Modifications**:

   - Respect the existing code style and patterns
   - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.6+ for Python utilities
   - Preserve type hints and docstrings when suggesting changes
   - For Fish scripts, ensure changes follow Fish syntax and idioms

2. **Error Analysis**:

   - Look for common issues first:
     - Missing dependencies
     - File permission problems
     - Invalid file paths
   - For Python tools, suggest debugging with increased verbosity

3. **Feature Additions**:

4. **Testing Suggestions**:
   - Recommend testing file operations in dry-run mode first
   - Suggest validating input data before operations
   - For Fish scripts, propose echo statements to trace execution

## Example Responses

### Example 1: User asking about orphaned-xmp usage

```bash
To find orphaned XMP files in your photography directory, you can use the orphaned-xmp tool like this:

1. Navigate to your photos directory:
   cd ~/Photos

2. Run the tool in dry-run mode first to see what would be deleted:
   python /path/to/myriad/python/orphaned-xmp/orphaned_xmp/cli.py --dry-run

3. If the results look correct and you want to delete the orphaned files:
   python /path/to/myriad/python/orphaned-xmp/orphaned_xmp/cli.py --delete

The tool will:
- Find all XMP files in the directory
- Check if each XMP file has a corresponding media file
- Report (or delete) XMP files without matching media files

This helps clean up your photo library by removing metadata files for images you've deleted.
```

### Example 2: User asking about modifying sixkcd.fish

````fish
To modify the sixkcd.fish script to display comics at a different size, you'll want to edit the image processing part of the script.

Look for this line around line 162:

```fish
fetch_url $xkcd_imgurl | magick - -resize 250% - | $DISPLAY_IMAGE
````

Change the 250% value to adjust the size. For example, to make it smaller:

```fish
fetch_url $xkcd_imgurl | magick - -resize 150% - | $DISPLAY_IMAGE
```

Or to make it larger:

```fish
fetch_url $xkcd_imgurl | magick - -resize 350% - | $DISPLAY_IMAGE
```

This works because the script uses ImageMagick to resize the image before displaying it with either imgcat (for iTerm2) or img2sixel (for terminals with sixel support).

Remember to make the script executable after editing:
chmod +x sixkcd.fish

### Example 3: User asking about netflow setup
```

To set up the netflow monitoring system described in the guide, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have the prerequisites:

   - A server/VM running Docker and Docker Compose
   - A Mikrotik router running RouterOS 7
   - Basic networking knowledge

2. Create the docker-compose.yml file:

   - Copy the example from the netflow/README.md file
   - Save it to a directory on your server

3. Create the ntopng.conf file in the same directory with the configuration from the guide

4. Start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Configure your Mikrotik router:

   - Enable Traffic Flow (IP â†’ Traffic Flow)
   - Add your Docker host as a target with port 2055 and version 9

6. Verify it's working:
   - Check container logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
   - Access ntopng web interface at <http://your-server-ip:3000>

The most common issues are:

- Firewall blocking UDP port 2055
- Incorrect IP address configuration
- Missing volumes for persistent data

Would you like me to help with any specific part of this setup?
