### Context

Being "active" in UK road culture signifies someone who is currently involved in street crime, gang conflicts, or "on road." The term indicates a person who doesn't just talk about street life but actually lives it. Being active is considered a valuable trait within roadman culture, as it signals reliability and readiness to engage in whatever activities are necessary for the group.

## Air

To harm/attack someone, especially with a knife.

### Context

## Allow It

  English: "I have some high-quality Amnesia Haze cannabis, costing Â£10 per gram."

British supermarket chain, mentioned in context of everyday life.

### Context

  English: "It's just joking conversation, don't be offended."

  English: "Someone was kicked in his backside."

- Roadman: "She's got a big batty still."
  English: "She has a large backside indeed."

In road culture, "beef" refers to ongoing conflicts that often lead to violence. These feuds can be between rival gangs, different postcodes, or individuals with a personal grudge. Beef is a central theme in drill music, where artists often reference ongoing conflicts and territorial disputes. Unlike minor disagreements, beef typically involves serious hostility and the potential for violent confrontation.

### Examples

- Roadman: "There's been beef between E8 and E5 for years."
  English: "There's been an ongoing feud between gangs from postcodes E8 and E5 for years."

  English: "I've been in my neighborhood since this morning."

- Roadman: "Man can't step on our block."

### Examples

As slang, "drill" also means to attack or shoot someone, reflecting the genre's themes. Sonically, UK drill is distinguished by its distinctive production style (typically 138-151 BPM), flow patterns, and UK-specific slang.

The blurred line between art and reality is a central feature of drill culture.

### Examples

- Roadman: "He's one of the hardest drillers in London."
  English: "He's one of the best drill rappers in London." (Or potentially: "He's one of the most violent gang members in London.")

### Examples

- Roadman: "That tune dropped last night, already viral."

## Ends

It carries connotations of belonging and identity â "my ends" means more than just where you live; it represents your home ground and community. In gang contexts, "ends" often align with postcodes and form the basis of territorial rivalries. The term is fundamental to UK drill identity, as postcode/area rivalries drive many conflicts described in lyrics.

  English: "I've been representing this neighborhood since the beginning."

## Field

War zone; area of conflict between rival gangs.

## GM

Gang Member or greeting (Good Morning).

### Context

Abbreviation with dual meaning: primarily "Gang Member" in drill contexts, but also can be used as a greeting ("Good Morning"). This ambiguity allows for plausible deniability in some contexts.

## Goal

It reinforces the competitive nature of postcode wars and territorial disputes.

### Examples

  English: "That was a successful attack against our rivals last night."

- Roadman: "Three goals this month, opps can't respond."

  English: "The light-skinned Black woman in the video."

## Got

Assaulted or robbed.

### Context

To "get got" means to be assaulted, robbed, or attacked.

This vagueness can be useful when discussing incidents without being explicit about the violence involved.

### Examples

- Roadman: "He got got outside the station."
  English: "He was attacked/robbed outside the train station."

- Roadman: "Three man got got in that incident."
  English: "Three people were assaulted/robbed in that incident."

Artists like Giggs became iconic figures who helped establish a distinctly British take on gangsta rap.

### Examples

- Roadman: "Man grew up on road rap before drill was a thing."
  English: "I was raised listening to UK gangsta rap before drill music existed."

- Roadman: "Giggs' early road rap tunes are still classics."
  English: "Giggs' early UK gangsta rap songs are still considered excellent."

- Roadman: "Road rap was more about the stories than the beats."
  English: "UK gangsta rap focused more on narrative lyrics than production quality."

## Roadman

### Context

A "roadman" is a young urban person who is immersed in street life â known for dressing in streetwear (tracksuit, puffer jacket), using Multicultural London English slang, and often hustling on road. The term can apply to actual gang members or those who mimic the style. "Man's been a roadman since young" indicates long-term involvement in street culture. The term encompasses involvement in various street activities including drug dealing, territorial disputes, and general street presence. In general, a roadman is the UK equivalent of a street hustler or youth gangster.

## Runner

Low-level drug courier, often a young person.

### Context

A "runner" is someone (often a younger individual) who transports drugs, money, or messages for higher-ups in a gang or drug operation. They literally "run" things between locations. In county lines operations, teenagers often act as runners carrying drugs from city to town. Runners are typically at the bottom of the drug-dealing hierarchy, vulnerable to exploitation by older gang members who stay more removed from direct handling of drugs to reduce their own risk.

### Examples

- Roadman: "Got youngers as runners taking packs up north."
  English: "We have young people as couriers transporting drugs to northern towns."

- Roadman: "Started as a runner, now he's got his own line."

### Context

### Context

A "samurai" refers to a large, curved blade similar to a samurai sword but in knife form. The term identifies a specific type of weapon more substantial than regular knives.

  English: "Someone produced a large machete-style knife during the conflict."

- Roadman: "Got caught with a samurai under his bed."
  English: "Police discovered a large curved blade concealed beneath his mattress."

## Sanctions

Revenge/retaliation against rivals.

### Context

In street slang, "sanctions" refers to punishment or retaliation against rivals. "Sanctions must be met" means revenge must be taken. The term is borrowed from political language to describe gang retaliation. It implies a formalized system of revenge or consequences within gang culture, where attacks on members are met with calculated responses. The use of political terminology adds a layer of perceived legitimacy to gang violence.

### Examples

- Roadman: "After what they did, sanctions are coming."
  English: "After their actions, we will enact revenge."

- Roadman: "Sanctions got put on their block last night."
  English: "Retaliatory violence was carried out in their neighborhood last night."

The term can admire fearlessness while acknowledging brutality. In broader youth slang, it can also be a compliment for someone who did something impressive, extreme, or brutally honest. The term has evolved from a purely negative descriptor to sometimes imply admiration for someone's intensity or commitment.

### Examples

- Roadman: "He stabbed three opps on his own â he's a savage."
  English: "He stabbed three rivals by himself â he's extremely ruthless."

## Score / Scoreboard

Tracking violent acts between rival gangs.

### Context

The concept of keeping track of attacks between rival gangs. "The score is 3-1" would indicate one gang has committed three significant acts of violence compared to their rivals' one. The "scoreboard" reflects the competitive nature of gang conflicts, where violent incidents are tallied like points in a game. This disturbing concept is frequently referenced in drill lyrics, where artists boast about their gang's "score" against rivals. This practice has been cited by authorities as evidence that drill music incites real violence.

### Examples

- Roadman: "The score's 2-0 to us this month."
  English: "We've attacked them twice this month with no retaliation from them."

- Roadman: "Man got put on the scoreboard last night."
  English: "Someone was attacked/killed last night, adding to the tally of victims."

## Scram

A small cheap pistol.

### Context

A "scram" is a small, cheap, often unreliable pistol. "Man pulled out a scram" means someone revealed a small handgun. The term refers specifically to low-quality, possibly improvised or converted firearms rather than more sophisticated weapons. These are typically small-caliber handguns that might be unreliable but are still dangerous and more easily concealed than larger firearms.

### Examples

- Roadman: "He tried to rob the shop with a scram."
  English: "He attempted to rob the store with a small handgun."

- Roadman: "Don't trust them scrams, they jam easy."
  English: "Don't rely on those cheap pistols, they malfunction easily."

  English: "I was seen with the small pistol, so I had to run away."

---

## Scrams

Guns.

### Context

"Scrams" is a plural form referring to firearms generally. While "scram" singular often means a small, cheap pistol specifically, "scrams" plural can refer to guns of various types. The term provides yet another coded reference to firearms in the extensive lexicon of weapon terminology in drill culture.

### Examples

- Roadman: "Opps have scrams, be careful."
  English: "Rivals possess firearms, exercise caution."

- Roadman: "Police found scrams during the raid."
  English: "Law enforcement discovered firearms during the search."

---

## Scrum

Female genitalia; sometimes a derogatory term for women.

### Context

A vulgar slang term for female genitalia or, by extension, women in general. Similar to "gash," it's a crude, sexualized reference. The term demonstrates some of the misogynistic elements that can be present in road slang, reducing women to sexual body parts.

### Examples

  English: "He's constantly pursuing women for sexual purposes."

- Roadman: "Don't talk about women like they're just scrum."
  English: "Don't refer to women in such a degrading, sexual manner."

Shanks are often improvised weapons, though in street contexts the term can refer to any knife carried for protection or violent intent. UK knife culture has unfortunately become a significant issue, with "shankings" (stabbings) a common theme in drill lyrics.

### Examples

- Roadman: "He's carrying a shank in his waistband."
  English: "He's carrying a knife in his waistband."

- Roadman: "Man got shanked outside the chicken shop."
  English: "Someone was stabbed outside the fried chicken restaurant."

### Context

### Examples

- Roadman: "Gonna link with the Sheff crew this weekend."
  English: "I'm meeting with the group from Sheffield this weekend."

- Roadman: "Sheff drill hits different from London."
  English: "Sheffield's drill music has a distinctly different style from London's."

## Shellin

### Context

"Shellin" has a dual meaning: it can refer to shooting firearms ("shelling" as in firing shells/bullets) or to performing drill music at a high level. This ambiguity is typical of drill terminology, where musical performance and actual violence are deliberately blurred. The term creates plausible deniability in lyrics while maintaining street credibility.

### Examples

### Examples

- Roadman: "Shit-den, did you see that police raid?"
  English: "Oh my goodness, did you witness that police operation?"

- Roadman: "Shit-den, they took all his money."
  English: "That's shocking, they stole all his money."

Distinguished from "runner" by having more agency and usually more seniority. The term is common in UK urban slang for someone actively selling drugs directly to users, rather than supplying other dealers.

### Context
