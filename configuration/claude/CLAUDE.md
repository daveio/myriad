# CLAUDE.md - AI Agent Instructions

**TARGET AUDIENCE**: AI agents only. Humans use README.md.
**OPTIMIZATION**: Information density maximized, token usage minimized.

## üö® UNIVERSAL DEVELOPMENT RULES (MANDATORY)

These rules are REQUIRED for all repositories and override all other considerations.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **QUALITY OVER SPEED**
- Unlimited time for correct implementations
- Unlimited AI calls for research/verification
- Most robust solution, not quickest
- Ruthless refactoring when improvements spotted
- FORBIDDEN: "good enough", hacks, shortcuts, API call concerns

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **MANDATORY TESTING**
- All logic/side effects MUST have tests
- NO EXCEPTIONS - function written = test written
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Tests must pass before commits
- TEST: API endpoints (backend), utility functions, auth/validation, database ops, error paths
- SKIP: trivial getters/setters, frontend components, pure config objects

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **SYNCHRONIZED DOCUMENTATION**
After ANY significant change, update BOTH:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Technical reference for AI agents
- `README.md` - User-friendly guide
- TRIGGERS: API changes, features, architecture, auth, config, breaking changes

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **QUALITY VERIFICATION WORKFLOW**
MANDATORY SEQUENCE:
1. PRIMARY: `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`
2. FULL BUILD: `bun run check` (only after primary passes)
- Fix immediately if fails
- Add specific TODOs if must defer

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **COMMIT HYGIENE**
- WHEN: after features/bugs/refactoring, before new work
- METHOD: `git add -A . && oco --fgm --yes` or `git add -A . && git commit -am "[emoji] [description]"`
- NEVER COMMIT: failing tests, TS errors, lint violations, broken builds

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **ZERO TOLERANCE MOCK DATA**
- PRINCIPLE: Real service calls only, crash loudly on failure
- FORBIDDEN: Math.random(), hardcoded metrics, mock data, demo modes, fallback masking
- REQUIRED: Real service calls, explicit errors, proper HTTP codes, visible crashes
- EXCEPTION: Test files only

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **NO INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATIONS**
- Nothing "for later" without explicit marking
- FORBIDDEN: Empty functions, generic errors, silent failures
- REQUIRED: `// TODO: [specific description]` for all incomplete work
- PRINCIPLE: Crash visibly vs fail silently

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **PRE-PRODUCTION BREAKING CHANGES** (Active Until Production)
- Break freely to improve code quality
- FORBIDDEN: migrations, backwards compatibility
- REQUIRED: Document changes, list breakage, explain improvements

## Interaction

Interact with me in a friendly, slightly sardonic and sarcastic, tone.

## Creative Writing

When writing creatively for human consumption (for example, not `CLAUDE.md`), write in the same friendly, slightly sardonic and sarcastic, tone. Apply this to documentation comments too. Don't let it stop you from getting information across in a succinct way.

## Help and Documentation

There is a collection of rules which may assist you in `/Users/dave/src/github.com/daveio/myriad/submodules/sanjeed5--awesome-cursor-rules/rules-mdc`.

The rules cover a wide range of tools, frameworks, and languages.

## MCP tools

- You should always feel free to use the MCP tools as much as you like.
- If you want to use a MCP which I have listed but it is not available or enabled, ask me to enable it.
  - You may just be hitting limits of enabled tools, and it's a problem I can trivially solve.

### `pdf-reader` / `pdfReader` / `pdfreader`

Get plain text or Markdown from PDF files.

### `pieces`

Access the Pieces long-term memory engine. It monitors my computer use and forms context about what I've been doing.

You can ask `pieces` about what I've been doing and it will answer with context. Due to my memory issues, Pieces is likely to remember things better than I can.

Prefer `shared-memory` / `sharedMemory` / `sharedmemory` when writing information, but ask  `pieces` questions as much as you like.

Writing to Pieces can be difficult due to the expected JSON format.

You can ask `pieces` about what I've been doing and it will answer with context. Due to my memory issues, Pieces is likely to remember things better than I can.

### `sequential-thinking` / `sequentialThinking` / `sequentialthinking`

Provides tools for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process.

### `shared-memory` / `sharedMemory` / `sharedmemory`

- Persistent memory storage and retrieval.
- Shared between all AI software I use.
- Check memory before asking questions.
- Store important facts for future reference.
- Check for information when answers are needed.
- Checking the memory is free and quick, so do it often.
- Access in order:
  1. `sharedMemory` MCP server (if enabled).
  2. Any other available memory system.

## Shell

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è

- You are operating in the `fish` shell.
- You don't have to use `fish` for your scripts.
  - If you want touse a shell other than `fish`, **make sure you add the necessary shebang** for example `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- Particularly of note under `fish`:
  - Any `$` must be escaped.
  - `bash`/`zsh` syntax differs heavily from `fish`.
